         It is the biggest planet in the solar system; so much so that it can fit all the planets inside
         itself and there's still room to spare. Jupiter is over 700 million kilometers away from the sun and over 500
         million kilometers from Earth. This was captured using my telescope and phone, stacked and processed.</td>
