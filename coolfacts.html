    <!--Random fact about Venus using a paragraph tag styled with CSS (uniform tag)-->
    <p class="paragraphStyle">Venus's axis is tilted 177&deg; degrees from its northern pole, meaning North is its South and
     South is its North; it basically rotates backwards. Although Venus and the Earth of similar diameters, 
     Venus is over 20x hotter than the Earth at a staggering 475&deg;C average surface temperature compared to
     Earths' 15&deg;C temperature.</p>

     <h4>2. Did you know that: Water in the upper troposphere and tropopause doesn't freeze below 0&deg;C?!</h4>
         <!--Random fact about supercooled water using a paragraph tag styled with CSS (uniform tag)-->
     <p class="paragraphStyle">As water evaporates from the Earths' surface, water vapours are sent to the upper portion of the troposphere in which
     clouds are created. After that, either water vapour stays in areas of the atmosphere where temperatures are above freezing or 
     they elevate higher as supercooled water where temperatures are below freezing. This is due to water molecules not completing
     a process called nucleation.</p>
