    <!-- This paragraph explains a recap of what we have done so far in GEOM 101: Web Design and Programming -->
    <p class="paragraphStyle">So far in this course, we learned plenty about HTML5 and the web. Firstly, we learned about the basics of the web such as web servers
    and clients, networking, and web addresses with its two layers: domain name and ip address. Secondly, we identified different URL types
    such as relative and absolute and their cryptic character encoding along with mapping Google Maps with API keys, putting that theory into
    practice. Lastly, we jumped right into HTML and CSS looking at examples of basic elements such as: text elements images, links, tables, 
    formatting, block elements, inline elements, and basic css properties.The fun thing about the course so far was Google API mapping.

    <p class="paragraphStyle">Below are some of the skills that we learned so far in this course with Googles' API using URLs: </p>
